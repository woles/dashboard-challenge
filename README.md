# Notes:

Tests are provided only for one function and one component (don't count test from `react-create-app`)

What we can do more? 

1) Tests for all components and utils functions. 
2) Loader for components waiting for data. 
3) Better chart interaction and optimization
4) Campaign filter optimization 
5) Styling
6) Aggregate data provided by BE
7) ... and far more other things

I just don't want to waist time for that
